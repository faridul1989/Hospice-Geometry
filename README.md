# Hospice-Geometry
Hospice geometry posits that traditional geometric concepts, such as points, lines, and shapes, are not fixed or static but are constantly changing. The term "hospice" is used metaphorically to describe this process, as geometry is continuously "dying" or dissolving and then being "reborn" or reformed in new ways.
